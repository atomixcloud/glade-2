Glade 0.5.11	(Oct 1 2000)
============

 o Added workaround for SEGV bug in GnomeMessageBox in gnome-libs 1.2.3.
 o A few changes in the generated code to keep g++ happy.

 o Changed the widget tree view so it automatically expands to show selected
   widgets.
 o Updates to Russian, Swedish, French, Korean and Japanese translations.


Glade 0.5.10	(Sep 24 2000)
============

 o Fixed code generation bug with GnomePropertyBox which caused a SEGV.
 o Added support for the "relief" property for GtkButton & GtkToggleButton.
   This is the only change to the XML file format.
 o Fixed menu editor bug which meant that widgets were occasionally given
   the same name.
 o Added support for tooltips for GtkRadioButton and GtkCheckButton.
 o Better support for keyboard navigation (from Jon K Hellan).
 o Fixed --write-source option so it handles relative paths (from Rick Niles).
 o Stopped installing logo into `gnome-config --datadir` since it causes
   problems for people installing in personal directories etc. Also changed
   the generated Makefile.am so it doesn't do it either.
 o Added 'Class' property to the property editor so you can see the class of
   the selected widget (from Jon K Hellan).
 o Output the GtkOptionMenu and GtkCombo item strings separately in the
   translatable strings file.
 o Allowed start & finish pages of a GnomeDruid to be removed, in case the
   developer wants to replace them with custom pages.
 o Fixed the 'Redisplay Window' (Ctl-R) command so it should work again.
 o Added the XML file and the autogen.sh file to the EXTRA_DIST in the
   generated Makefile.am so they get distributed with the project.


Glade 0.5.9	(May 20 2000)
===========

 o Added a Turbo-Start Guide from Paul J. Drongowski.
 o Patches from James M. Cape to allow setting of the Title of GnomeMessageBox
   widgets, and setting all the standard window properties of GnomePropertyBox.
 o Updated Norwegian, Russian, Swedish, Japanese and German translations.


Glade 0.5.8	(May 14 2000)
===========

 o Added User Guide and FAQ to the Help menu, though these are unfinished.
 o Added option to support the Gnome Help system. Currently this only adds the
   GNOME_UIINFO_HELP macro to the GnomeUIInfo struct, though we may include a
   complete template User Guide with all the build files in future. Note that
   you will have to install the topic.dat file in the appropriate directory
   for the Help menuitems to be added. See the Glade source for an example.
 o Installed the menu hints in the GnomeAppBar.
 o Added a '--write-source' command line option to just build the source code
   and exit. Note that an X connection is probably necessay for this to work.
 o Partial support for GnomeDB widgets, though you'll have to set up the
   configure.in/Makefile.am yourself. Parts of this may be unfinished.
 o The beginnings of support for Bonobo controls. To include this configure
   with '--with-bonobo'. This is still unfinished. Source code output isn't
   done.
 o Lots of new translations (many thanks to the people who do this behind the
   scenes).


Glade 0.5.7	(Feb 19 2000)
===========

 o Fixed problem with gnome-gettext.m4 macros being removed.
 o French, Swedish, Japanese & Norwegian translations updated.


Glade 0.5.6	(Feb 13 2000)
===========

 o Bug fixes -	XML/source code output for box children with PACK_END set.
		Using normal pixmaps in menu items.
		Used correct default for C++ option cxx_use_heap, so it doesn't
		appear in projects for other languages.
		Fixed code output for children of paned widgets.
		Fixed progress bar bug.
		Fixed GLADE_DATA_DIR so --datadir works.
		Fix bug which caused widgets to be skipped in code output.
 o Used WM_NAME & WM_CLASS properties so window positions can be saved by the
   window manager.
 o Defaults for project options - to cut down on XML output. More default
   values will be used in future - see doc/file_format.txt.

Glade 0.5.5	(Nov 11 1999)
===========

 o Bug fixes -	fixed accelerator keys dialog so the GTK+ version compiles.
		output (void) as the function prototypes in interface.c


Glade 0.5.4	(Nov 6 1999)
===========

 o Added back the 'Data' & 'Object' fields on the 'Signals' page, though I
   still think people shouldn't use these.
 o Added some support for GnomeAnimator. You just have to add the frames of the
   animation yourself.
 o Moved accelerator keys from a property editor page to a separate dialog,
   which you can access via the 'Basic' page of the property editor.
 o Bug fixes -	Allow label to be removed from buttons etc.
		Make sure GnomeDruid strings are translated.
		Don't let widgets be added to GnomeCanvas.
		Don't let child widgets of GtkEntry/GnomeEntry etc. be deleted.
		Ignore <style> stuff in XML file.


Glade 0.5.3	(Sep 12 1999)
===========

 o Better support for scrollable widgets. Scrolled windows and viewports are
   added automatically if needed.
 o Bug fixes.


Glade 0.5.2	(Sep 5 1999)
===========

 o New widgets -
      GtkLayout
      GnomeDruid (+ GnomeDruidPageStart/Standard/Finish)
      GnomeIconList
      GnomeIconSelection
      GnomePropertyBox
      GnomePixmap
 o Made it possible to specify the widget to set the keyboard focus to when
   an underlined accelerator key is pressed. (Though there are still problems
   with underlined accelerator keys, e.g. they won't work well in notebooks.)
 o Removed the unfinished support for styles, since it caused problems
   (especially when people were using themes).
 o Bug fixes.


Glade 0.5.1	(Aug 1 1999)
===========

This release contains:

 o New widget properties -
     GtkWindow & dialog subclasses now have default width & height properties.
     GtkPaned has Position property, and children have Shrink & Resize packing
	properties.
     GtkMenubar has shadow type property.
     GtkHandleBox has shadow type, handle position & snap edge properties.
     GtkBox children have Position property (which isn't saved in the XML),
	though this may be a little confusing due to the PACK_START/END flag.
 o More support for underlined accelerator keys. If the label in a button has
   an underlined character, then the button can be activated by pressing
   Alt + the underlined key. Similarly if a normal label has an underlined
   character, pressing Alt + the key will set the keyboard focus to the widget
   on the right, e.g. a text entry box.
 o Ctrl-R accelerator to redisplay a window - it should appear at the same size
   it will be in the final application. Very handy.
 o Bug fixes, including a fairly serious one in the generated code which meant
   that widgets were never destroyed.


Glade 0.5.0	(Jun 20 1999)
===========

This release adds support for Gnome applications.
It is an unstable release, likely to contain quite a few bugs, and so should
not be used for serious development.

 o Gnome support, including support for creating all the configuration files
   necessary for building a Gnome app, and support for a number of Gnome
   widgets (though there's still a few to add). You can now create a simple
   Gnome application in minutes!
 o Better support for gettext - Glade now outputs everything needed to use
   gettext in an application. All you need to add is the list of languages
   supported, in configure.in, and the po files containing the translated
   strings, in the po/ subdirectory.
 o Better support for pixmaps - Glade now outputs everything needed to install
   the pixmaps used by the application, and to distribute them with your app.
   All you need to do is add the pixmaps to the interface within Glade!
 o Simpler project setup - new projects are given default options for
   everything, so you can now save projects and build the source with a few
   mouse clicks! Projects are by default placed in $HOME/Projects.
 o Better source code output - gladesrc.c & gladesig.c have been renamed to
   interface.c and callbacks.c respectively, the support functions have been
   moved to a new file, support.c, and the main() function is now output in
   its own file, main.c.
 o Better error messages - no more "Error writing source" dialogs, I hope!


Glade 0.4.1	(Mar 28 1999)
===========

This release mainly fixes a few bugs discovered in 0.4.0. 

Note that to update old projects to work with Glade 0.4.1 you may need to add
AM_CONFIG_HEADER (config.h) to your project's configure.in, after
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.

 o Fixed tooltips bug which meant that all tooltips were lost. 
 o Fixed problem when setting of x & y properties of widgets in fixed
   containers. 
 o Fixed problems setting the project filename and directory options. This
   could cause Glade to hang when saving a project. 
 o Added support for running external source code generators when the project
   language option is set to C++ or Ada 95. 
 o Added confirmation dialog when creating new project, to try to ensure that
   no work is accidentally lost. 
 o Changed the way in which x, y, width & height properties are set, to make it
   obvious when these have been set by the user, and to make it easy to revert
   to default values. 
 o Fixed compilation problem when using Gnome and --disable-nls. 
 o Fixed bug in example application which stopped it form working when
   installed. 
 o Added doc/upgrading-to-gtk-1.1.txt which describes problems which may occur
   when upgrading a GTK+ 1.0 application to 1.1/1.2. 

This is the last release to support GTK+ 1.0.


Glade 0.4.0	(Mar 21 1999)
===========

 o Cut & Paste support with a clipboard containing multiple cuttings.
 o Support for GtkToolbar, GtkPixmap & GtkCalendar widgets.
   Updated support for GtkProgressBar (for GTK+ 1.2).
 o A new multi-page palette.
 o A new toolbar with convenient Open/Save/Options/Build buttons.
 o Support for typing label text while the mouse hovers above a label.
 o Faster loading of project files & writing of C source.
 o Complete rewrite of project-related code.
 o Russian & Japanese translations.
 o An example application - a simple text editor, with a menubar and toolbar.
 o Several bug fixes.


Glade 0.3.9	(Dec 1 1998)
===========

Minor fixes to work with GTK 1.1.5. 


Glade 0.3.8	(Nov 30 1998)
===========

Incorporates the patch to 0.3.7 which fixed one problem with updating the
source code. 
Fixed bug reading dates in the XML file. 
Updated the code to work with the latest GTK (1.1.5). 


Glade 0.3.7	(Nov 17 1998)
===========

Developers release.

Signal handlers are not overwritten each time the source code is output.
Instead any new/changed signal handlers are appended to the file.
It is up to the user to delete any old handlers and copy code across,
but it's much better than before.

You can now run 'glade filename' to load an XML file on startup.

Bug fixes: writing source for popup menu in GTK 1.1 caused SEGV,
the clist got fixed twice for 0.3.6 but it should now be OK.


Glade 0.3.6	(Nov 12 1998)
===========

Developers release, incorporating several patches sent to me.

It now runs using the latest GTK in CVS - with themes. Still needs work.

Spanish translations (only in the full version).

Bug fixes: stopped combo box from grabbing the pointer and making it
impossible to select anything. CList labels in GTK 1.1 weren't being saved
or having the source code written.


Glade 0.3.5	(Oct 3 1998)
===========

Support for menu bars and popup menus.

Support for accelerators (mainly for the menubars).

French and German translations.

Bug fixes including: combo lists and resizing, widget resizing, frame
labels, the preview widget type property, the scale widget digits property,
empty buttons, event prototype output in GTK 1.1, the project clist in GTK 1.1,
and more i18n changes (I daren't say fixes for these!).


Glade 0.3.4	(Aug 31 1998)
===========

I think I've fixed the i18n configuration/compilation stuff.
(This may also have caused problems with the XML output from Glade, since
some numbers may have been written in the local format and so won't be
read in again properly.)

Partial support for some of the GTK 1.1 widgets, e.g. GtkPacker.

Easier compilation & recompilation - a simple Makefile is output to create
the initial configure script etc., and the configure.in and Makefile.am are not
overwritten so you only have to type 'make' each time.

A number of minor bug fixes (thanks for the bug reports!).


Glade 0.3.3	(16 Aug 1998)
===========

Support for GtkNotebook and GtkInputDialog.

GtkDialog, GtkColorSelectionDialog & GtkFileSelectionDialog should work now.

Better redrawing of widgets when selected/deselected.

Support for gettext, with partial support for Portuguese (Brazilian).
(May be some compilation problems as I had to change the configure stuff.)

Support for GTK 1.1. Glade should now compile and run with GTK 1.1, though
the new widgets are not supported yet.

Several minor bug fixes, mostly related to source code output.

Moved all source code into glade subdirectory.

Got rid of 'holding widgets' - previously inserted above widgets with no
windows so that we can get events for them. These proved too awkward.
We now use the widget tree exactly as it will be in the finished program.
The event handlers are more intelligent so they can figure out which widget
the event is really for.
