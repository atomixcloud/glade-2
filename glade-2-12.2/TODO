Note that there won't be much new development on this version of Glade any
more. As soon as everything works for GTK+ 2 and GNOME 2, only bug fixes
will be allowed.

A rewrite of Glade (called Glade 3) is underway, and is in the glade3
module in the GNOME cvs repository.


Minor bugs & notes
==================

 o i18n UTF-8 bug - filenames etc. see bug #107696
   o source.c - generated code that uses filenames. What do we do?
   o gnome_program_locate_file() uses on-disk encoding. check calls.
     - used in source.c, gnomepixmap.c generated code.
     - only used for pixmaps/pixbufs.
     - just recommend people use ASCII only for filenames? Yes.

 o Is there a problem with stock buttons and i18n? Outputting translated
   names in code? See Peeter Vois message on glade-users. Also bug 98510.
   For some menuitems which aren't stock items, it outputs the native
   language as the label text, which may not be wanted.
   Also, it uses the native language for part of the signal handler function
   names. Not sure what to do here. Some people may want to use native
   language labels and names, and some may want to use English.

 o X11 dependency patch. bug 107450. for directfb.

 o Should add a Role property to windows at some point. Though I don't think
   it is a GObject property so libglade needs to support it.

 o Grid/Snap settings should be in project options, so other developers use
   the same settings (What if different windows want different settings?).
   Move to Options dialog. Move 'Show Widget Tooltips' to View menu for now.
   Get rid of 'Settings' menu.

 o Should get rid of GtkCLists & other badly deprecated stuff.

 o Optional int properties - we currently use a checkbutton with no label, but
   it doesn't receive the input focus. Use a checkbutton with indicator off?
   with tick and cross icons? There is a GTK+ bug & patch about this issue.

 o Look for code that iterates over strings. need to use UTF8 functions.
   - project options stuff that creates options automatically.
   - widget name stuff?
   - signal handler name stuff in menu editor.
   - will only become a problem when non-ASCII used.

 o popup menus - make sure correct menu items are displayed - for widgets
   which can't be deleted/have event boxes added etc.

 o buttons with label & icon. Bad interactions between label field in button
   and label, e.g. if you select the label and turn markup on, then select the
   button and enter bad markup.

   Either
    o Turn markup off when we set the label in the button.
    o Use common function to set the label from the button.
      But will this work for all buttons? in libglade?

 o radio groups - the widgets don't update well when you move them between
   groups, e.g. sometimes no widgets in the group are selected. I'm not sure
   if this matters.

 o When a widget is selected/deselected, we should update all open dialogs
   to reflect the new widgets settings, e.g. signals dialogs.
